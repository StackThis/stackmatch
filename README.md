# Gridmatch


[Gridmatch](http://gridmatch.meteor.com/) is based on the turn-based card matching game commonly known as [Concentration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29). Each player takes a turn flipping two cards face up. If the cards match, they will add to their score and are removed from play. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back face down before the next turn. The twists in this version are that each matching pair has a different score added to your total, and to beware of the “bomb” cards! They will subtract points when accidentally matched.

You have a choice of a little game (40 cards) or a big game (56 cards). When queueing up a new game, you will receive a direct link to send to a friend. Also, you game will be listed in the game queue on the main page. Instead of queueing up a new game, you may join a game already queued by clicking on it on the main page. You may leave a game at any time, but you will be forfieting to the other player. At the end of play, when all matches are revealed, you may restart a new game of the same size.

The application was created using the Meteor platform for reactivity that supports such head-to-head applications.
