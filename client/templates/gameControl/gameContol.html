      <p>Gridmatch is based on the turn-based card matching game commonly known as concentration.</p>
      <p>Each player takes a turn flipping two cards face up. If the cards match, they will add to their score and are removed from play. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back face down before the next turn.</p>
      <p>The twists in this version are that each matching pair has a different score added to your total, and to beware of the “bomb” cards! They will subtract points when accidentally matched.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
